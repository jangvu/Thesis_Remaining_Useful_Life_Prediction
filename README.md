# Thesis_Remaining_Useful_Life_Prediction
My thesis is inspired by Prognostics and health management, which is an important topic in industry for predicting state of assets to avoid downtime and failures.
Dataset: NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps)

In this thesis, I started from Vanila-LSTM to predict RUL. In order to get a better result, I experienced many different architecture such as: LSTM + Attetion, BiLSTM + Attention, CNN + LSTM, CNN + LSTM + Attention, ResNet + LSTM.
